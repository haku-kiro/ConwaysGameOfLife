# ConwaysGameOfLife

Project to visualize random iterations of Conways Game of Life

## Contents

- This Repo contains two projects.
  - A C# console application that simulates the game of life, [Conways Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
  - As well as python file to normalize and render a plot of the games iterations.

## Purpose

- Just messing around with [Cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) There's not much else to it.

### Side notes

- If you do use this, make sure you change the paths that the files are generated to (In the c# application) as well as the path the files are read from (python application)
- There are very few dependencies in the c# application (dotnet core console application). And the python script only imports pandas and matplotlib.pyplot
